## \todo:
## Add dtex and rat files to this test and compare them against the deep exr.

## \todo:
## Fix this test. It currently is failing becuase the call to deepSample() isn't returning the value of the deep pixel.
## When testing this inside nuke, it appears that a correct result is given on occasion and in the other cases, the
## cache needs to be refreshed before the deepSample returns a correct result. This may be due to a bug in nuke
## or an error in the IECoreNuke::DeepImageReader code. Further investigation is required.
