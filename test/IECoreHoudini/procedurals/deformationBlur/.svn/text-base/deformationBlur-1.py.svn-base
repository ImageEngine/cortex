# Deformation Blur
#
# This cookbook example injects two different geometries at different time
# two time samples creating deformation blur.
#
# Motion blur is defined in a very similar fashion to RenderMan. First we call
# motionBegin() with a list of time samples. You can have as many motion samples
# as your renderer will allow. For each time sample we then inject some
# geometry. It is important that the topology remain consistent between time
# samples, otherwise the renderer will complain. We finish by calling
# motionEnd(). Remember not to inject anything but geometry samples between
# motionBegin() and motionEnd().
#
# Don't forget to turn on motion blur in your renderer
#
# In OpenGL all samples will be rendered simultaneously. Refer to the
# RenderSwitch example for code that can differentiate based on which renderer
# is currently rendering.
#
# In general the code will look like:
#
#      renderer.motionBegin( [ sample1, sample2, ... ] )
#      sample1_geometry.render( renderer )
#      sample2_geometry.render( renderer )
#      ...
#      renderer.motionEnd()
