# Transformation Blur
#
# This cookbook example injects multiple transformation matrices at different
# time samples. These transforms move a single geometry over time, causing
# transformation motion blur.
#
# Motion blur is defined in a very similar fashion to RenderMan. First we call
# motionBegin() with a list of time samples. You can have as many motion samples
# as your renderer will allow. For each time sample we then inject a
# transformation matrix. We finish by calling motionEnd(). Remember not to
# inject anything but transformation matrices (one per sample) between
# motionBegin() and motionEnd(). Be sure not to mix up deformation blur and
# transformation blur samples between the same motionBegin() and motionEnd()
# statements.
#
# Don't forget to turn on motion blur in your renderer
#
# In OpenGL all samples will be rendered simultaneously. Refer to the
# RenderSwitch example for code that can differentiate based on which renderer
# is currently rendering.
#
# In general the code will look like:
#
#      renderer.motionBegin( [ sample1, sample2, ... ] )
#      renderer.concatTransform( matrix1 )
#      renderer.concatTransform( matrix2 )
#      ...
#      renderer.motionEnd()
#      geometry.render( renderer )
