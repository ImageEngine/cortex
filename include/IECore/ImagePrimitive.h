/// ImagePrimitive represents a 2D bitmap in the form of individual channels, which are stored as primitive variables.
/// A channel may contain any data vector type, but the Ops that manipulate images implemented in Cortex are specific for
/// float ( 32-bit ) type. The interpretation of these channels broadly matches the EXR
/// specification - the following channel names have the specified special meanings, but arbitrary channel names
/// are permitted and their interpretation is left to the application :
///
///    "R"                      Red<br>
///    "G"                      Green<br>
///    "B"                      Blue<br>
///    "A"                      Alpha<br>
///    "Y"                      Luminance for greyscale images<br>
///
/// Within the channel's data buffers themselves the pixel values are stored in row major order,
/// that is to say pixels which are adjacent in X (which runs along the "width" of the image) are also
/// adjacent in memory.
///
/// An ImagePrimitive defines both a "display window" and a "data window", both of which are specified in
/// pixel space. The display window defines the overall size of the image, whereas the data window defines
/// the specific region for which we hold data. In most cases the data window will be equal to, or a sub-region
/// of the display window. Outside of the data window the values of the ImagePrimitive's channels are defined
/// to be zero (i.e. black/transparent). This means that the number of data elements stored in each
/// channel should equal to the area of the data window.
///
/// In object-space, the ImagePrimitive is represented as a plane centered on the origin, with size (width, height) in axes (X, Y).
/// The normal is pointing down the negative Z-axis.
///
/// Pixel-space runs from the display window origin in the top-left corner, to the display window's maximum in
/// the bottom-right corner. Pixels of ascending X coordinate therefore run left-right, and pixels of ascending
/// Y coordinate run top-bottom.
///
/// UV-space has the same orientation as pixel-space, and is defined to be (0,0) at the origin of the display window
/// and (1,1) at the maximum of the display window.
///
/// \todo Define standard depth channel ("Z"? "depth"?)
/// \todo I think we should perhaps rethink the centering of the object space. It seems odd that rendering two images
/// where one has an offset display window should result in them rendering over the top of each other.
