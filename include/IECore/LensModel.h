///
/// The LensModel class is the base for all IECore lens models which implements a simple framework for writing arbitrary lens distortion models.
/// A simple interface is exposed in the form of the validate(), distort(), undistort() methods which should be reimplemented by any subclass to
/// evaluate the parameters and perform the distortion of a point in UV space.
///
/// The static LensModel::create() methods are implemented as factory functions for creating LensModels. Derived classes should define a static instance
/// of the LensModel::LensModelRegistration<> which will register it will the factory functions. A vector of all registered lens models can be returned by
/// calling LensModel::lensModels(). As the factory functions were implemented to ensure correct initialization of the lens models, all derived classes
/// should make their default constructor protected and add LensModel as a friend class.
///
/// LensModels can be serialized by just writing out the CompoundObject that contains it's parameters. LensModels can be easily loaded by just
/// passing the same compound object containing it's parameter's values into LensModel::create().
///
/// To use an object derived from LensModel:
/// * First populate the parameters with values.
/// * Call validate() to validate the parameters and set up any internal state as necessary.
/// * Call distort(), undistort() or bounds() as desired to query distorted UV values.
