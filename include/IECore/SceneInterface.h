/// A pure virtual base class for navigating a hierarchical animated 3D scene.
/// A scene is defined by a hierarchy of named 3D transforms.
/// Each SceneInterface instance maps to a specific transform in a scene, uniquely identified by it's path.
/// A path is an array of transform names.
/// Using the method child, you can explore the hierarchy (and create new transforms).
/// Each transform on the hierarchy has a unique name and contains the 3D transformation, custom attributes, tags,
/// a bounding box, a main object and more child transforms. All of them can be animated.
/// Animation is stored by providing the time and the value. And it's retrieved by querying it's value at any time, and if the 
/// animation is inherently sampled, interpolation will be applied for queries on attributes, objects, transforms and bounds. 
/// The path to the root transform is an empty array. The name of the root transform is "/" though.
/// The root transform by definition cannot store transformation or an object. Attributes and Tags are allowed.
/// Tags are string labels assigned to any location in a scene and they are propagated up and down in the hierarchy
/// when the scene is saved to files, so they can be used for efficiently filtering the hierarchy. 
/// Check on the Maya and Houdini scene reader nodes for examples on how to filter by tag.
/// \ingroup ioGroup
/// \todo Implement a TransformStack class that can represent any custom 
/// transformation that could be interpolated and consider using it here as the
/// returned type as opposed to DataPtr.
