/// The following macros and functions provide a good example to follow in trying to
/// wrap non trivial C++ objects so they can be derived from in Python, as they solve
/// some issues the boost python documentation is silent about.
///
/// The first macro simply defines a virtual override for valueValid(), so that calls coming
/// from the C++ side will be forwarded on to the python reimplementation in the python
/// derived class. This is pretty standard and follows the boost documentation examples.
/// The macro is provided as every class to be used as a base class for python subclassing
/// must define the override, and we don't want to define the same code over and over in
/// each of the wrapping classes.
///
/// The next bit is more interesting. We'd like to simply bind the virtual Parameter::valueValid()
/// function in to python at the Parameter base class, and leave it at that. That works fine
/// until it becomes necessary for a python subclass to call the base class implementation
/// of valueValid() (this is part of the definition for how valueValid() should be implemented).
/// At this point the binding would resolve to the virtual function, which would fall through
/// to the most derived class implementation, which would forward it into python, creating
/// an infinite loop of recursive calls to the python valueValid() implementation. So instead
/// of binding the virtual valueValid() function at the base class level, we have to bind
/// valueValid repeatedly in every derived class, this time binding a direct call to the appropriate
/// derived class function (statically, not virtually). The second macro is used to achieve that.

/// Use this within the definition of a Wrapper class for a Parameter derived class.
/// It defines virtual overrides to forward calls into python as appropriate.
/// See src/bindings/PathParameterBinding.cpp for an example of use, and the discussion above
/// for a description of what is going on.
