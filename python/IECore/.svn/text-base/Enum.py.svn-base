## Creates a new class which provides enum-like functionality.
# The class has an attribute for each name passed, whose value is
# the instance of the Enum for that name. Enum instances hold an
# integer value which can be retrieved using int( e ), and the
# name that value signifies can be retrieved using str( e ). Enum
# instances can be compared for equality and hashed to allow their use
# in dictionaries etc.
#
# For example :
#
# > E = IECore.Enum.create( "Apple", "Orange" )
# > a = E.Apple
# > print a, int( a )
#
# Apple, 0
#
# assert( E.Orange == E( 1 ) )
# assert( E.Orange != E.Apple )
