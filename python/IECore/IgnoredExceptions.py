## A context object intended for use with python's "with" syntax. It is used
# to replace this idiom :
#
# try :
#	value = someThing["with"]["keys"]["that"]["may"]["not"]["exist"]
# except KeyError :
#	pass
#
# with something slightly more concise and expressive of what is happening :
#
# with IgnoredExceptions( KeyError ) :
#	value = someThing["with"]["keys"]["that"]["may"]["not"]["exist"]
#
class IgnoredExceptions :

	## Accepts a variable number of exception types - these will be silently
	# ignored if they are thrown from within the body of the block.
	def __init__( self, *args ) :

		self.__toIgnore = args

	def __enter__( self ) :

		pass

	def __exit__( self, type, value, traceBack ) :

		if isinstance( value, self.__toIgnore ) :
			return True
				
		if type is not None and issubclass( type, self.__toIgnore ) :
			return True
