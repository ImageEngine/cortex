	## Derived classes must create a ui element which is the parent of the
	# rest of their ui, and call this init function passing it as the topLevelUI
	# parameter. The base class will ensure that the UIElement instance is kept
	# alive as long as the ui exists, and that it will be destroyed when the
	# ui is destroyed.

	## It's very natural to assign member functions to ui callbacks. There is a problem
	# with this however in that maya leaks references to any python callbacks passed
	# to it (tested in maya 2008). This causes a reference to be held to the UIElement
	# instance forever. This could be a real problem if the ui references significant amounts
	# of memory, which it may well do. This class wraps a callback function in such a way
	# that maya will not leak it.
	#
	# Example usage : maya.cmds.button( command=self._createCallback( self.__buttonPressed ) )
	#
	# If the mel parameter is True then it causes the creation of a mel command to call back and
	# invoke the python callback. This is useful for the cases where maya insists on treating callbacks as
	# mel commands even when they're added from python - for instance the outlinerEditor selectCommand
	# in maya 2008.

			return "python( \"%s\" )" % pythonCmd

	## This is called when the maya ui element corresponding to this
	# instance is deleted. It may be reimplemented by derived classes
	# to perform any necessary cleanup. One item of cleanup that might be
	# very important is to delete any IECoreMaya.CallbackId objects that
	# may be linking a maya message to a method of the instance - if this
	# is not done then a circular reference will prevent the instance from
	# dying, and the callbacks will continue to be despatched despite the
	# fact that the ui has long gone.
