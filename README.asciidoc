== Cortex ==

The Cortex project provides a set of high quality C++ libraries and Python modules tailored for software development in the visual effects industry. Rather than producing end user tools, the project focuses on creating a reusable set of modules of use to TDs and programmers in a broad range of scenarios - allowing them to focus on the more interesting or innovative aspects of development.
