# GitHub Action workflow variables can be populated at run-time by echoing special
# strings to an env file. The following allows vars to be set:
#
#   https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#environment-files
#
#   echo var=value >> $GITHUB_ENV
#
# We make use of this mechanism to allow custom logic to define the build name
# as well as determine the correct commit hash depending on the nature of the
# trigger. These variables can be referenced in a pipeline yaml file downstream
# of the step that runs this script.

# Actions is somewhat sparse in what information is available via the GITHUB_*
# env vars (from the github context). There is however a veritable treasure
# trove in the .json file pointed to by GITHUB_EVENT_PATH. "The Internets" seem
# to suggest this is the most reliable way of determining information about the
# triggering commit. Some of the official context vars may vary after a retry,
# etc. too.
#
# The contents of this file is based on the webhook payload so should be
# relatively stable as it is part of that public API.
