# Cortex #

Cortex is a framework for computation, rendering, and file I/O that provides a set of high-quality C++ libraries and Python modules tailored for software development in the VFX industry. This project focuses on creating a set of practical and reusable modules for technical directors, CG supervisors, and programmers, freeing them to focus on innovation and new features in their software projects.

You can find out more from our [introductory paper on Cortex](https://github.com/ImageEngine/cortex/wiki/pdfs/AnOpenSourceFrameworkForVisualEffectsSoftwareDevelopment.pdf) and the [Cortex presentations at SIGGRAPH 2011](https://vimeo.com/album/5504655).

For a proof-of-concept demonstration of Cortex’s power as a framework, see [Gaffer](https://gafferhq.org), an open-source, node-based application designed for flexible scene building, rendering, and pipeline automation.

Participation in the Cortex project requires abiding by its [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
